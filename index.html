    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Im not so good at about me’s, when put on the spot I freeze when it come to talking about myself. Unless we’re like hanging out our something then I’ll anxiously start humble bragging. It more of a social tick than me stroking my ego. Anyway, 34 year olds, I grew up in Chicago Il, I’m a pieces and my favorite color is purple. I can seem a bit of a contrarian sometimes but i have some how managed to learn how to use this trait to think out side of the box and make creative solutions. I love to tinker, people are usually shocked that i still write in cursive. uhm yeah . . . </p>
