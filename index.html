    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>34 year olds, I grew up in Chicago Il, I’m a pieces and my favorite color is purple. I can seem a bit of a contrarian sometimes but I have some how managed to learn how to use this trait to think out side of the box for reative solutions. I love to tinker, people are usually shocked that I still write in cursive. uhm yeah . . . </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I’ve had a blend of mechanical hydraulic electrical and software. When I left high school I enlisted in the United States Airfare where I worked as a mechanic on the F-15. There we maintained and deployed with the 389th and EMS squadron in Mountain Home AFB. After my enlistment was up I attended Depaul university where I studied computer science and minored in photography. Here I began to miss getting dirty and turning wrenches so when an opportunity arose to work for Tesla automation I thought it would be the perfect blend of technology and maintenance. There I worked on automated guided vehicles which delivered various parts between manufacturing lines. I very much loved this job but also really wanted to get back to Idaho. During covid I would take almost weekly trips back to Idaho to visit friends. One visit i stumbled across a company that was using automation to build modular homes. Once again  I jumped on that chance. At this time I I felt a bit underwhelmed as there processes seem to run almost too well. Here in Idaho i have a home and felt the need to settle in. I noticed that some of my friends had cool jobs coding and worked from home. I got a bit jealous and thought it would be a good time to refresh my coding skill. From here I can go two ways, finish a coding boot camp at Epicodus and use this skills to better trouble shoot the coding that runs these automated manufacturing processes. Or, apply my skills to a more code intensive job. Either way i’m excite to see where life takes me next. </p>
